Senderon is a token focused on creating and supporting business opportunities and projects in and around the cryptocurrency world.
 Whether it be an already-existing projects or a basic idea in its early conception, Senderon welcomes any opportunity to assist and be involved.

Senderon will accomplish this in a number of ways (see the whitepaper) but the core ideal of Senderon is this: to be involved in as many quality crypto projects as possible and to be able to fund the next up and coming.
We also welcome others to use our platform for similar purposes. We hope that, with time and as our user base begins to grow, the platform becomes a hub for the next generation of successful cryptocurrency applications.
